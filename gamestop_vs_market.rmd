## Correlations

Everyone is talking about Gamestop these days and I can't deny there's an interesting story there, I'm just not sure exactly what it is.  I was reading one person's take on it the other day and they were describing how they believe that there will be some major market movement whenever the ball finally drops on the short interest in that stock.  One of the main thrusts of their argument was to say that Gamestop has been inversely correlated with the market overall and that this is due to the short interests having to sell other stocks - dropping their price - in order to have money to make Gamestop purchases or re-up on their short inerest, which increases Gamestop's price.  Seems reasonable, and I too have noticed that Gamestop has - at least recently - been performing the opposite of the rest of the market.  This workbook is my effort to prove - or disprove - this correlation.

For the purposes of this workbook, I will only be going as granular as daily performance.  I don't have a good way right now for intraday data.

First, we're going to load our data.  For simplicity's sake, I'm just going to compare $GME$ to $SPY$

``` {r load_data}

symbols <- c("GME", "SPY", "BBY")
stock_returns <- symbols %>%
    tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
           from = "2018-01-01",
           to   = Sys.Date()) 

stock_returns_daily <- stock_returns %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select      = adjusted,
               mutate_fun  = periodReturn,
               period      ="daily",
               col_rename  = "Ra")
```

``` {r perform_ccf}

GME <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "GME"]
SPY <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "SPY"]
BBY <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "BBY"]
ccfvalues <- ccf(SPY, GME, 10)
ccfvalues

```

``` {r lag2.plot}
astsa::lag2.plot(SPY, GME,10)
```

From this output we can say pretty conclusively that, at least in the daily numbers, $GME$ and $SPY$ are not closely correlated.  All of the correlation coefficients are less than 0.10 and there is a lot of variance from one day to the next.  For comparison, let's see how it would fare against a similar business, $BBY$.

``` {r bby.lag2.plot}
bbyccfvalues <- ccf(BBY,GME,10)
bbyccfvalues
```

Here we can see that there is indeed a correlation between GME and BBY, though not a particularly strong one.  What's interesting is that GME appears to predict BBY instead of the other way around.  You can see this in how the largest bars from the above chart are when Lag is >0.  We're going to try and predict $BBY$ using $GME$ with a 1 and 2 day lag using a linear model.  Let's see how this goes...

``` {r predict_bby}
x <- cbind(lag(GME), lag(GME, n=2))
y <- BBY
linear_model <- lm(y~x)
summary(linear_model)
```

From this output we can see that while there does appear to be a linear correlation between $GME$ 1-day and 2-day lag against $BBY$, the P values are above the 5% threshold so I would generally accept the null hypothesis that there is no correlation.  Additionally, the R-squared is only 0.01 so even if they were significant it doesn't explain enough of the $BBY$ movement to be worth caring about.

## Recent History

So we've proven that overall, from 2018-today there's no correlation between $GME$ and $SPY$, and that while there is a slight correlation between $GME$ and $BBY$ it's not enough for a linear model within a 95% confidence interval.  But let's go back to the original problem - Gamestop's recent volatility appearing to be linked negatively to the market.  Perhaps our window is too large.  Let's re-run the analysis looking only at what's happened from January 13, 2021 forward.  January 13th is when there was a 57% price jump in a single day and a massive spike in trading volume.

``` {r}
stock_returns_daily_reduced <- stock_returns[stock_returns$date >= as.Date("2021-01-13"),] %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select      = adjusted,
               mutate_fun  = periodReturn,
               period      ="daily",
               col_rename  = "Ra")
```

``` {r perform_ccf_reduced}

GME_reduced <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "GME"]
SPY_reduced <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "SPY"]
BBY_reduced <- stock_returns_daily$Ra[stock_returns_daily$symbol == "BBY"]
ccfvalues_reduced <- ccf(SPY_reduced, GME_reduced, 10)
ccfvalues_reduced

```

``` {r reduced_lag2.plot}
astsa::lag2.plot(SPY_reduced, GME_reduced,10)
```

Once again, we see there is no meaningful correlation nor predictive value.  Sorry, reddit poster.  It looks like your premise is flawed.  I think that's about it for that theory today.
