## Revenue

The first place I started to look was at Revenue. This appeared to be
the easiest area of the budget to line up year over year as accounts do
not appear to change drastically from year to year. In 2017-2018 the
government collected $152B which climbed to $158B in 2020. They are
forecasting a dip in 2021 which appears to come mostly from reductions
in corporate tax collected. In 2018-19, $16.6B was collected, which
reduced to $15.4B in 2019-20 and even further to $11.4B in 2020-21. It
is expected to recover to $14.4B in 2022.
